## Begin the Begin

I've been working on changing up my "infrastructure".
I'm transitioning away from the grandfathered Cloudsites setup that we've been using for 15 years or so.
Also added in the mix is github deployment via ionos.
To get things rolling, I dusted off the old blog and hooked it up to a workflow.

Much more to come.

Here's some topics we'll probably continue to keep track of. ;)
