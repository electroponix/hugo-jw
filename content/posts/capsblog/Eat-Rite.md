🏴‍☠️ Captain’s Blog - Eat-Rite

This one hurts. Again.

<!--more-->

In the glory days of soulard.com, we spent many a late night soaking up our alcohol with a delicious slinger.

It also seems I broke the news, despite none of the news outlets giving me credit.

We have to figure out a way to keep this around. Maybe team it up with a new Pot-in-the-Box (now legal).

Woe is us.
