üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Captain‚Äôs Blog - Eat-Rite

This one hurts. Again.

<!--more-->

In the glory days of soulard.com, we spent many a late night soaking up our alcohol with a delicious slinger.

We have to figure out a way to keep this around. Maybe team it up with a new Pot-in-the-Box (now legal).

Woe is us.
